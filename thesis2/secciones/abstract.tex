\Large \vspace{-1.5cm} \textbf{Machine Learning pipeline for automatic labeling
in Peruvian fish species images}
\end{center}

Machine Learning (ML) stands out as a fundamental tool for image 
detection and classification. However, training advanced models 
requires a large number of labeled images and significant 
computational power. This task is especially challenging in the 
context of Peruvian marine fauna, due to the scarcity of labeled 
specimens. To address this problem, an automatic fish labeler was 
developed based on a Deep Learning (DL) pipeline. This pipeline 
uses a pretrained detector (YoloV5 and Unidet) and a classifier 
based on CNNs (EfficientNetB0). The selection of the classifier 
was based on an exhaustive analysis of various state-of-the-art 
models, considering the size in memory, the number of parameters 
and the precision obtained with the research data sets. The practical 
results showed a partial precision of the detector of 79.45\%, while 
the classifier reached 91.47\%, thus generating a final accuracy of
72.67\%. In addition, a minimum error of 22.54\% was achieved and a 
real-time application was developed that reached up to 8 fps, which 
allowed the image labeling task to be automated.
